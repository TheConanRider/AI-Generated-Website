#AI Generated Website

Simple website generated by ChatGPT Dec 15 Version

After seeing a post about a simple error in HTML, I decided to go down a rabbit hole messing around with ChatGPT. I have included a transcript of the conversation here. Nothing really noteable but it was quite intresting seeing what the AI could achieve.

Most intresting parts are how the AI made the website "prettier" and the attempt to fix an issue with videos not autoplaying (an issue that turned out to be Google Chrome's policy with embedded YouTube videos).

I still have this chat active so I may go back in the future and ask the AI to add more "features"
